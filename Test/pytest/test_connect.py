    """Check it is not possible to connect with str version of MAC address

    While this might sound like a good idea, we designed the API to assume
    that the type of the identifier object specifies the type of the
    identifier. If you want to connect to an STU with a certain MAC address
    (e.g. ``08-6B-D7-01-DE-81``) you need to use an ``EUI`` (Extended Unique
    Identifier aka MAC address) object. If you use the **string
    representation** then the (fixed version of) ``STU.connect_sensor_device``
    assumes that you want to to connect to a **device with the name**
    ``08-6B-D7-01-DE-81``.
