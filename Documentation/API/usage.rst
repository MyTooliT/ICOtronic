Connection
##########

Connecting to STU
*****************

To communicate with the ICOtronic system use the the async context manager of the :class:`Connection` class to open and close the connection to the STU:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection

   >>> async def create_and_shutdown_connection():
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         pass # ← Your code goes here

   >>> run(create_and_shutdown_connection())

Connecting to Sensor Node
*************************

To connect to a sensor node (e.g. SHA, SMH, STH) use the async context manager of the coroutine :meth:`STU.connect_sensor_node`. To connect to a node you need to know one of the `identifiers of the node`_. In the example below we connect to a node with the name ``Test-STH``:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from netaddr import EUI
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection

   >>> async def connect_to_sensor_node(identifier):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier) as sensor_node:
   ...             return await sensor_node.get_mac_address()

   >>> mac_address = run(connect_to_sensor_node("Test-STH"))
   >>> isinstance(mac_address, EUI)
   True

By default :meth:`STU.connect_sensor_node` assumes that you want to connect to a generic sensor node (e.g. a sensory milling head (SMH)). To connect to an STH (a sensor node with additional functionality), use :class:`STH` for the ``sensor_node_class`` parameter:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection, STH

   >>> async def get_sensor_range(identifier):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier, STH) as sth:
   ...             return await sth.get_acceleration_sensor_range_in_g()

   >>> sensor_range = run(get_sensor_range("Test-STH"))
   >>> 0 <= sensor_range <= 200
   True

Streaming
#########

Reading Data
************


After you connected to the sensor node use the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.open_data_stream` to open the data stream and an ``async for`` statement to iterate over the received streaming data. The following code:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection
   >>> from icotronic.can import StreamingConfiguration

   >>> async def read_streaming_data():
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node("Test-STH") as sensor_node:
   ...             channels = StreamingConfiguration(first=True)
   ...             async with sensor_node.open_data_stream(channels) as stream:
   ...                 async for data, lost_messages in stream:
   ...                     return data

   >>> data = run(read_streaming_data())

   >>> # Example Output: [32579, 32637, 32575]@1724251001.976368 #123
   >>> data # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
   [..., ..., ...]@... #...

   >>> len(data.values)
   3
   >>> isinstance(data.timestamp, float)
   True
   >>> all(0 <= value <= 2**16-1 for value in data.values)
   True
   >>> 0 <= data.counter <= 255
   True

- connects to a node called ``Test-STH``,
- opens a data stream for the first measurement channel,
- receives a single streaming data object,
- prints its representation and
- shows some of the properties of the streaming data object.

The data returned by the ``async for`` (``stream``) is an object of the class :class:`StreamingData` with the following attributes:

- :attr:`StreamingData.values`: a list containing either two or three values,
- :attr:`StreamingData.timestamp`: the timestamp when the data was collected
- :attr:`StreamingData.counter`: a cyclic message counter (0 – 255) that can be used to detect data loss

.. note::
   The amount of data stored in :attr:`StreamingData.values` depends on the enabled streaming channels. For the `recommended amount of one or three enabled channels`_ the list contains three values. For

   - one enabled channel all three values belong to the same channel, while
   - for the three enabled channels

     - the first value belongs to the first channel,
     - the second value belongs to the second channel,
     - and the third value belongs to the third channel.

.. |recommended amount of one or three enabled channels| replace:: **recommended amount** of one or three enabled channels
.. _recommended amount of one or three enabled channels: https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOtronic/#channel-selection

By default :attr:`StreamingData.values` contains 16-bit ADC values. To convert the data into multiples of g (`the standard gravity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity>`_) you can

- use the coroutine :meth:`STH.get_acceleration_conversion_function` to retrieve a function that converts 16-bit ADC values values into multiples of g and then
- use this function to convert streaming data with the method :meth:`StreamingData.apply`.

In the example below we convert the first retrieved streaming data object and return it:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection
   >>> from icotronic.can import STH, StreamingConfiguration

   >>> async def read_streaming_data_g():
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node("Test-STH", STH) as sth:
   ...             conversion_to_g = (await
   ...                 sth.get_acceleration_conversion_function())
   ...             channels = StreamingConfiguration(first=True)
   ...             async with sth.open_data_stream(channels) as stream:
   ...                 async for data, lost_messages in stream:
   ...                     data.apply(conversion_to_g)
   ...                     return data

   >>> streaming_data = run(read_streaming_data_g())
   >>> len(streaming_data.values)
   3
   >>> all([-100 <= value <= 100 for value in streaming_data.values])
   True

Collecting Multiple Values
**************************

While working directly with the class :class:`StreamingData` might make sense for small projects often you:

- want to collect a bunch of data values,
- work on data for a specific measurement channel, or
- convert data values.

.. currentmodule:: icotronic.measurement

For that case you can use the class :class:`MeasurementData`. The example code below

- collects data for all three measurement channels,
- applies a conversion into multiples of g for the first channel (only) and
- checks that the values for the first channel are all between -2 g and 2 g.

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from time import monotonic
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection, STH, StreamingConfiguration
   >>> from icotronic.measurement import Conversion, MeasurementData

   >>> async def collect_streaming_data(identifier):
   ...    async with Connection() as stu:
   ...        async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier, STH) as sth:
   ...            conversion_to_g = (await
   ...                sth.get_acceleration_conversion_function())
   ...            all_channels = StreamingConfiguration(
   ...                first=True, second=True, third=True
   ...            )
   ...            measurement_data = MeasurementData(all_channels)
   ...            async with sth.open_data_stream(all_channels) as stream:
   ...                messages = 10
   ...                async for data, _ in stream:
   ...                    measurement_data.append(data)
   ...                    messages -= 1
   ...                    if messages <= 0:
   ...                        break
   ...            measurement_data.apply(Conversion(first=conversion_to_g))
   ...            return measurement_data

   >>> data = run(collect_streaming_data(identifier="Test-STH"))
   >>> first_channel_in_g = data.first()
   >>> all(-2 <= data.value <= 2 for data in first_channel_in_g)
   True

Converting Data Values
======================

The class :class:`Conversion` allows you to apply different functions to the different channels of the streaming data (attributes ``first``, ``second`` and ``third``). Each function gets a measurement value (of type ``float``) and should return a value of type ``float``. If you do not want to apply any conversion to a certain channel you can use the (default value) of ``None`` for the :class:`Conversion` channel attribute. In the example below we apply a Conversion object that

- does not change the data for the first channel,
- multiplies the values of the second channel by two and
- adds the value ``10`` to the data of the second channel.

.. doctest::

   >>> from icotronic.can import StreamingConfiguration, StreamingData
   >>> from icotronic.measurement import Conversion, MeasurementData

   >>> measurement_data = MeasurementData(
   ...     StreamingConfiguration(first=True, second=True, third=True))
   >>> s1 = StreamingData(counter=1, timestamp=1757946559.499677,
   ...                    values=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
   >>> s2 = StreamingData(counter=2, timestamp=1757946559.499680,
   ...                    values=[4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
   >>> measurement_data.append(s1)
   >>> measurement_data.append(s2)
   >>> measurement_data
   Channel 1 enabled, Channel 2 enabled, Channel 3 enabled
   [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]@1757946559.499677 #1
   [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]@1757946559.49968 #2

   ...     return value * 2
   >>> conversion = Conversion(second=multiply_by_two,
   ...                         third=(lambda value: value + 10))
   >>> measurement_data.apply(conversion)
   Channel 1 enabled, Channel 2 enabled, Channel 3 enabled
   [1.0, 4.0, 13.0]@1757946559.499677 #1

   16.0@1757946559.49968 #2

Storing Data
************

If you want to store streaming data for later use you can use the :class:`Storage` class to open a context manager that lets you store data as `HDF5`_ file via the method :func:`add_streaming_data` of the class :class:`StorageData`. The code below shows how to store one second of measurement data in a file called ``measurement.hdf5``.

.. _HDF5: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format

.. doctest:: store

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from pathlib import Path
   >>> from time import monotonic
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection, STH, StreamingConfiguration
   >>> from icotronic.measurement import Storage

   >>> async def store_streaming_data(identifier, storage):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier, STH) as sth:
   ...             conversion_to_g = (await
   ...                 sth.get_acceleration_conversion_function())
   ...
   ...             # Store acceleration range as metadata
   ...             storage.write_sensor_range(
   ...                 await sth.get_acceleration_sensor_range_in_g()
   ...             )
   ...             # Store sampling rate (and ADC configuration as metadata)
   ...             storage.write_sample_rate(await sth.get_adc_configuration())
   ...
   ...             async with sth.open_data_stream(
   ...                 storage.streaming_configuration
   ...             ) as stream:
   ...                 # Read data for about one seconds
   ...                 end = monotonic() + 1
   ...                 async for data, _ in stream:
   ...                     # Convert from ADC bit value into multiples of g
   ...                     storage.add_streaming_data(
   ...                         data.apply(conversion_to_g))
   ...                     if monotonic() > end:
   ...                         break

   >>> filepath = Path("measurement.hdf5") # Store data in HDF5 file
   >>> with Storage(filepath, StreamingConfiguration(first=True)) as storage:
   ...     run(store_streaming_data("Test-STH", storage))

.. testcleanup:: store

   >>> filepath.unlink() # Remove data after you are done working with it

Since `HDF5`_ is a standard file format you can use general purpose tools such as `HDFView`_ to view the stored data. To specifically analyze the data produced by the ICOtronic package you can also use one of the scripts of the `ICOlyzer package`_.

For more information about the measurement format, please take a look at the section `“Measurement Data”`_ of the general ICOtronic package documentation.

Determining Data Loss
*********************

.. currentmodule:: icotronic.can.streaming

Sometimes the

- **connection** to your sensor node might be **bad** or
- code might run **too slow to retrieve/process streaming data**.

In both cases there will be some form of data loss. The ICOtronic library currently takes multiple measures to detect data loss.

Bad Connection
==============

The iterator for streaming data :class:`AsyncStreamBuffer` will raise a :class:`StreamingTimeoutError`, if there is **no streaming data for a certain amount of time** (default: 5 seconds). The class :class:`AsyncStreamBuffer` also provides access to statistics that can be used to determine the amount of lost data. For example, if you iterate through the streaming messages with ``async for``, then in addition to the streaming data, the iterator will also return the **amount of lost messages since the last successfully received message** (``lost_messages`` in the example below):

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   async with sensor_node.open_data_stream(channels) as stream:
       async for data, lost_messages in stream:
           if lost_messages > 0:
               print(f"Lost {lost_messages} messages!")

To access the overall data quality, since the start of streaming you can use the method :meth:`AsyncStreamBuffer.dataloss`. The example code below shows how to use this method:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from time import monotonic
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection, StreamingConfiguration

   >>> async def determine_data_loss(identifier):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier) as sensor_node:
   ...              end = monotonic() + 1 # Read data for roughly one second
   ...              channels = StreamingConfiguration(first=True)
   ...              async with sensor_node.open_data_stream(channels) as stream:
   ...                  async for data, lost_messages in stream:
   ...                      if monotonic() > end:
   ...                          break
   ...
   ...                  return stream.dataloss()

   >>> data_loss = run(determine_data_loss(identifier="Test-STH"))
   >>> data_loss < 0.2 # We assume that the data loss was less than 20 %
   True

If you want to calculate the amount of data loss for a specific time-span you can use the method :meth:`AsyncStreamBuffer.reset_stats` to reset the message statistics at the start of the time-span. In the following example we stream data for (roughly) 2.1 seconds and return a list with the amount of data loss over periods of 0.5 seconds:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from time import monotonic
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection, StreamingConfiguration

   >>> async def determine_data_loss(identifier):
   ...       async with Connection() as stu:
   ...           async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier) as sensor_node:
   ...               start = monotonic()
   ...               end = start + 2.1
   ...               last_reset = start
   ...               data_lost = []
   ...               channels = StreamingConfiguration(first=True)
   ...               async with sensor_node.open_data_stream(channels) as stream:
   ...                   async for data, lost_messages in stream:
   ...                       current = monotonic()
   ...                       if current >= last_reset + 0.5:
   ...                          data_lost.append(stream.dataloss())
   ...                          stream.reset_stats()
   ...                          last_reset = current
   ...                       if current > end:
   ...                           break
   ...
   ...                   return data_lost

   >>> data_lost = run(determine_data_loss(identifier="Test-STH"))
   >>> len(data_lost)
   4
   >>> all(map(lambda loss: loss < 0.1, data_lost))
   True

.. note:: We used a overall runtime of 2.1 seconds, since in a timing interval of 2 seconds there is always the possibility that the code above either returns three or four data loss values depending on the specific timing.

Slow Processing of Data
-----------------------

The buffer of the CAN controller is only able to store a certain amount of streaming messages before it has to drop them to make room for new ones. For this reason the ICOtronic library will raise a :class:`StreamingBufferError`, if the buffer for streaming messages exceeds a certain threshold (default: 10 000 messages).

Auxiliary Functionality
#######################

Reading Names
*************

After your are connected to a node you can read its (advertisement) name using the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.get_name`:

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection

   >>> async def read_sensor_name(name):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(name) as sensor_node:
   ...             sensor_name = await sensor_node.get_name()
   ...             return sensor_name

   >>> sensor_name = "Test-STH"
   >>> run(read_sensor_name(sensor_name))
   'Test-STH'

Changing ADC Configuration
**************************

To change

- the sample rate/frequency (via prescaler, acquisition time and oversampling rate) or
- the reference voltage

of the analog digital converter (ADC) of your sensor node you can use the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.set_adc_configuration`. Since all of the parameters of this coroutine use default values, you can also just call it without changing any parameters to apply the default ADC configuration.

.. note:: Some sensor nodes use a different reference voltage (**not 3.3V**), in this case applying the default configuration might not be what you want.

To retrieve the current ADC configuration use the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.get_adc_configuration`, which will return an :class:`ADCConfiguration` object. This object provides the method :meth:`ADCConfiguration.sample_rate` to calculate the sampling rate/frequency based on the current value of prescaler, acquisition time and oversampling rate.

In the example below we

- apply the default ADC configuration on the sensor node,
- retrieve the configuration via the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.get_adc_configuration`, and then
- print the sampling rate/frequency based on the retrieved ADC configuration values.

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection
   >>> from icotronic.can.adc import ADCConfiguration

   >>> async def write_read_adc_config(name):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(name) as sensor_node:
   ...             # Set default configuration
   ...             await sensor_node.set_adc_configuration()
   ...             # Retrieve ADC configuration
   ...             adc_configuration = await sensor_node.get_adc_configuration()
   ...             print("Sample Rate: "
   ...                   f"{adc_configuration.sample_rate():0.2f} Hz")

   >>> run(write_read_adc_config("Test-STH"))
   Sample Rate: 9523.81 Hz

One option to decrease the sample rate from the default value of about 9524 Hz is to change the

- prescaler,
- acquisition time or
- oversampling rate.

For a

- formula on how to calculate the sample rate based on the values above and
- a list of suggested sample rates

please take a look at the section `“Sampling Rate”`_ of the general ICOtronic system documentation. The example code below shows you how to change the sample rate to about 4762 Hz.

.. doctest::

   >>> from asyncio import run
   >>> from icotronic.can import Connection
   >>> from icotronic.can.adc import ADCConfiguration

   >>> async def change_sample_rate(name):
   ...     async with Connection() as stu:
   ...         async with stu.connect_sensor_node(name) as sensor_node:
   ...             # Retrieve current reference voltage
   ...             adc_configuration = await sensor_node.get_adc_configuration()
   ...             reference_voltage = adc_configuration.reference_voltage
   ...             # Change sample rate
   ...             configuration = ADCConfiguration(
   ...                                 prescaler=2,
   ...                                 acquisition_time=8,
   ...                                 oversampling_rate=128,
   ...                                 reference_voltage=reference_voltage)
   ...             print("Set sample rate to "
   ...                   f"{configuration.sample_rate():0.2f} Hz")
   ...             await sensor_node.set_adc_configuration(**configuration)

   >>> run(change_sample_rate("Test-STH"))
   Set sample rate to 4761.90 Hz

Changing Channel Configuration
******************************

Some ICOtronic sensor nodes support changing the mapping from the three available measurement channels to different sensor channels. To get the current mapping you can use the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.get_sensor_configuration`. The following code:

.. code-block::

   from asyncio import run
   from icotronic.can import Connection
   from icotronic.can.error import UnsupportedFeatureException

   async def read_sensor_configuration(identifier):
      async with Connection() as stu:
           async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier) as sensor_node:
               try:
                   print(await sensor_node.get_sensor_configuration())
               except UnsupportedFeatureException as error:
                   print(error)

   run(read_sensor_configuration("Test-STH"))

will either

- print the current sensor configuration e.g.::

    M1: S1, M2: S2, M3: S3

- or print an error message::

    Reading sensor configuration not supported

  if the sensor node does not support getting (or setting) the sensor configuration.

To set the sensor configuration you can use the coroutine :meth:`SensorNode.set_sensor_configuration`.

.. currentmodule:: icotronic.measurement.sensor

The method expects a :class:`SensorConfiguration` object as parameter. The following code:

.. code-block::

   from asyncio import run
   from icotronic.can import Connection, SensorConfiguration
   from icotronic.can.error import UnsupportedFeatureException

   async def set_sensor_configuration(identifier):
       async with Connection() as stu:
           async with stu.connect_sensor_node(identifier) as sensor_node:
               try:
                   config = await sensor_node.get_sensor_configuration()
                   print(f"Sensor configuration: {config}")
                   await sensor_node.set_sensor_configuration(
                       SensorConfiguration(first=2, second=4, third=1)
                   )
                   config = await sensor_node.get_sensor_configuration()
                   print(f"Updated sensor configuration: {config}")
               except UnsupportedFeatureException:
                   print("Sensor configuration not supported by device")

   run(set_sensor_configuration("Test-STH"))


will set the sensor configuration for

- the first measurement channel to the sensor channel `2`,
- the second measurement channel to the sensor channel `4`, and
- the third measurement channel to the sensor channel `1`.

For hardware that supports channel configuration the code should print the following text::

  Sensor configuration: M1: S1, M2: S2, M3: S3
  Updated sensor configuration: M1: S2, M2: S4, M3: S1
