- Move functions for checking commandline arguments into `icotronic.cmdline.types` so other packages can use it. Before this an import like:

  ```sh
  from icotronic.cmdline.parse import node_name
  ```

  **would not work** due to a circular dependency. With the updated code you now can import a function like `node_name` with the code:

  ```sh
  from icotronic.cmdline.types import node_name
  ```
