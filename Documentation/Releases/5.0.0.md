# General

# ICOn

## Dataloss

- Fix `icon dataloss` command on Windows (issue [#26](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOtronic/issues/26))

## Streaming

- The [streaming interface] now returns timestamps that take the timing difference of CAN messages and the current (operating) system time into account. This update should improve the accuracy of the timestamp information on macOS and Windows. For more information, please take a look at issue [#24](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOtronic/issues/24).
