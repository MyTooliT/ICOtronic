# General

- Remove support for Python `3.11`
  - We removed support for this Python version, since we use the parameter `delete_on_close` of [`NamedTemporaryFile`](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile), which was introduced in Python `3.12`

# ICOn

## Dataloss

- Fix `icon dataloss` command on Windows (issue [#26](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOtronic/issues/26))

# Hardware Tests

- You do not need to set the serial number of the programming board in the configuration anymore, as it is not required (at least when you only use a single programming board)

# API

## Commander

- Remove programmer serial number attribute, as it seems to not be required for any of the commands we use
- Add parameters for chip (microprocessor type) to methods that require this information

## Measurement

- Add new `MeasurementData` class which can be used to collect multiple `StreamingData` objects

## Storage

- Add method to write `MeasurementData` objects: `StorageData.add_measurement_data`

## Streaming

- The [streaming interface](https://icotronic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#streaming) now returns timestamps that take the timing difference of CAN messages and the current (operating) system time into account. This update should improve the accuracy of the timestamp information on macOS and Windows. For more information, please take a look at issue [#24](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOtronic/issues/24).

# Documentation

- Use `pyproject.toml` for “[Read the Docs](https://icotronic.readthedocs.io)” build instead of extra `requirements.txt` file
