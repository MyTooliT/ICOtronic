# Version 3.1

## API

- Added easier option to retrieve the Bluetooth advertisement name of the STU

  **Note:** Retrieving the name of the STU is probably not something you need, unless you want to flash a new STU firmware onto the STU using OTA (over the air) update mode.

- Add coroutine to collect sensor nodes (over time):

  ```py
  STU.collect_sensor_nodes
  ```

  This coroutine tries to find sensor node (using `STU.list_sensor_nodes`), until
  - no new sensor devices are found or
  - until a given timeout expired.

### Scripts

## ICOn

- Improve logic for determining list of available sensor devices
