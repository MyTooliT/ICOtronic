# Project

We now use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as build backend instead of [Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io)

# API

## ADC

- The default values for the `ADCConfiguration`:
  - Prescaler: 2
  - Acquisition Time: 8
  - Oversampling Rate: 64

  are now the same as the one a [default configuration of a sensor device](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#setting-at-reset)

## STU

- Fix bug in `STU.connect_sensor_device`, where the coroutine would connect you to a sensor device with a certain MAC address, if you specify the MAC address as string argument.

  While this might sound like a good idea, we designed the API to assume that the type of the identifier object specifies the [type of the identifier](https://mytoolit.github.io/ICOtronic/#sensor-node-identifiers). If you want to connect to an STU with a certain MAC address (e.g. `08-6B-D7-01-DE-81`) you need to use an `EUI` (Extended Unique Identifier aka MAC address) object. If you use the **string representation** then the (fixed version of) `STU.connect_sensor_node` assumes that you want to to connect to a **node with the name** `08-6B-D7-01-DE-81`.

  Since the previous version of `STU.connect_sensor_node` connected to a sensor node, if you specify the MAC address as string argument, we consider this update a braking change and hence a reason to release a major version update. If you used the broken functionality before, aka something like

  ```py
  mac_address = "08-6B-D7-01-DE-81"
  async with Connection() as stu:
      async with stu.connect_sensor_node(mac_address) as sensor_node:
          pass
  ```

  then please replace the code with something like:

  ```py
  mac_address = EUI("08-6B-D7-01-DE-81")
  async with Connection() as stu:
      async with stu.connect_sensor_node(mac_address) as sensor_node:
          pass
  ```

  if you use ICOtronic `4.0.0` or a later version of the library.

- The coroutine `STU.connect_sensor_device` now checks the validity of the identifier argument
