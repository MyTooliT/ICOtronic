# API

- **Remove** method to list enabled channel numbers of sensor configuration: [`SensorConfiguration.enabled_channels()`](https://icotronic.readthedocs.io/en/6.2.0/api.html#icotronic.can.SensorConfiguration.enabled_channels)

  While this is a **breaking change compared to version `6.2.0`** we assume that nobody uses the function yet. Unfortunately we noticed that the method is
  - not very useful and
  - can be easily confused with providing the same functionality as [`StreamingConfiguration.enabled_channels`](https://icotronic.readthedocs.io/en/6.2.0/api.html#icotronic.can.streaming.StreamingConfiguration.enabled_channels).

  If you still want the functionality that the function provided you can use a list comprehension instead of the removed `SensorConfiguration.enabled_channels`:

  ```py
  from icotronic.can import SensorConfiguration

  sensor_configuration = SensorConfiguration(first=10, third=30)
  [value for value in sensor_configuration.values() if value != 0]
  # => [10, 30]
  ```

- Extend the coroutines
  - `STH.get_acceleration_sensor_range_in_g` and
  - `STH.get_acceleration_conversion_function`

  with the parameters:
  - `ignore_errors`, which can be used to ignore errors, when reading the EEPROM sensor range value and
  - `default`, which specifies the default sensor range, if the sensor range could not be determined from the EEPROM value (and `ignore_errors` is set to `True`).

# CI

- Disable macOS Python 3.14 build, since the only version of HDF5 supported by Homebrew: [HDF5 `2.0`](https://www.hdfgroup.org/2025/11/10/release-of-hdf5-2-0-0-newsletter-207/) is not supported by (one of the library requirements) the [PyTables](https://www.pytables.org) library yet.
