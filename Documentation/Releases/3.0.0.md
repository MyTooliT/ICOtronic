## Version 3.0

> **Note:** This is the first release of this package under the name `ICOtronic`. Previous version of this package were released under the name [ICOc](https://pypi.org/project/icoc).

### General

- All code for the CAN communication is now based on [`python-can`](https://python-can.readthedocs.io)
- We now officially support Linux, macOS and Windows

### API

- Added new code to specify [blocks and block commands](https://mytoolit.github.io/Documentation/#blocks)
- The API now uses [multiple specific classes (`Connection`, `STU`, `STH`, …) to communicate with the ICOtronic system](https://github.com/MyTooliT/ICOtronic/issues/13) instead of one large class (`Network`). For more information about the new API, please take a look at the [API documentation](https://icotronic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
